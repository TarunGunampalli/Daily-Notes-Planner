# Daily Tasks Planner

Chrome extension built for easy, simple tasks listing. Every morning, add any tasks you want to complete for the day. The extension was built for simplicity and motivation, so all you can do once the tasks are added is clear them all at the end of the day.

If you don't complete every single task that day, you have to keep them all and add more for the next day, forcing you to build up more until you can finally clear them out. This can help motivate you to aim high each morning and stay productive throughout the day.

Color scheme built to match chrome dark theme.

Future Improvements:
Integrate REACT for better styling and UI
